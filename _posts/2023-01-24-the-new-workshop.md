### What does this even mean?

As you might or might not know, I've been working for Nexile for a good while now. If this is all new for you, I recommend you to watch the following clip.

<div class="frame-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tAWlGysHZhE?clip=UgkxCJz6z98xU6O-d_c3nGDNOCtTuuyiXUlU&amp;clipt=EK6vCBiFxQo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Even though it might sound like I've been working for just couple weeks since the reveal, I've actually been working with Nexile for what could be six months at this point and by the time this blogpost goes up, the new update will be released as a beta.

### What's this update?
{: #update }

Okay let's take a step back.

As ThomasOfTawny mentioned in the clip above, this free update will be community-oriented.<br>Some, many have speculated that this will be something that has to do with Workshop...

![lmao](/images/blog3-1.png)

Yes, it is confirmed now.

**Jump King is getting a Workshop update**, but not just like a JumpKingPlus preinstalled binary where you have to rename folders and files that mess like what we used to do before, a **proper update** for Jump King. Meaning you should expect some **JumpKingPlus features** be present in the new vanilla Jump King, some **new features** and **improvements** and **bug fixes**. The full list of changes are available in the [Jump King Update Changelog]() though.

### How will the 
In order to achieve

### New documentation
{: #documentation }

I've gained enough feedback by you guys over on [Discord server](https://discord.gg/{{site.footer-links.discord}}) tell me and the others how the current JumpKingPlus documentation is kind of slim, misses details and can be wrong at times. Which sucks because I believe the documentation is the point where a newbie wanting to create something for Jump King stops doing so because of it's complexity.

That's why, in collaboration with Nexile, **the documentation is getting an overhaul**!

The new documentation is not going to be hosted over on the JumpKingPlus site but somewhere rather more fitting; it's now part of Nexile's website!

### Will the update affect the speedrunners?
{: #speedrunning }

Yes and no, it depends.

It is possible to speedrun Jump King during this quote-on-quote beta of an update, but it's like playing Jump King on release, there aren't tools like JumpKingManager to let you train well one specific jump or a wind cycle. It's kind of awkward.

That's why future interests are to **fix JumpKingManager and LiveSplits for Jump King** to work with the newest version of Jump King that way doing speedruns won't change a single bit.

What will be an issue for the Speedrunning Moderation team are the **changes brought with Jump King relating to blocks**, such as low gravity and warp blocks. Warp blocks are following the new [v1.8.2 changes](/publicv182) and playing all levels with low gravity will be slightly slower than in JumpKingPlus, but more on that on the [Jump King Update Changelog]().

### What will happen to JumpKingPlus and its workshop?
{: #jumpkingplus-and-workshop }

Where most JumpKingPlus features by Nexile have been pleasantly ported over, some have been left out purposely. While **I totally understand and agree** on the reasons given, I don't like removing features especially if they are **deep-rooted of some user's muscle memory** or made for ease of use.

JumpKingPlus was born as a modified (or enhanced) version of Jump King. I can't tell how the future of JumpKingPlus will look like but I hope a solution will be found within Nexile in the future. There's a chance that JumpKingPlus will make it on the Workshop as a mod even if **it would need heavy reworks**.

Meanwhile for the Workshop, it will still be **available for the following months while the Steam Workshop update for Jump King is getting worked on**, but eventually when the update will be available to the public and made stable, **the JumpKingPlus' Workshop and its content will be archived**, meaning all the obsolete old download links will be removed and replaced with their relative Steam Item links. 

While it might be the end for JumpKingPlus here, it won't mean all will be lost! ðŸ™‚
