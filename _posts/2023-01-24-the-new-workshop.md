### What does this even mean?

As you might or might not know, I've been working for Nexile for a good while now.

You might think I've just been hired by them couple weeks ago but I've actually been working with Nexile for what could be six months at this point, Thomas covers very well what I am doing without going too much in detail.

### New documentation

I've gained enough feedback by you guys over on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/{{site.footer-links.discord}}) saying how the current JumpKingPlus documentation is kind of slim, misses details and can be wrong at times. That's why me and Thomas decided to remake it (*kind of*).

### Will the update affect the speedrunners?

Yesn't.

My future interests are to **fix JumpKingManager and LiveSplits for Jump King** to work with the newest version of Jump King that way doing speedruns won't be an issue (since LiveSplits have been broken since v1.7).

What will be an issue for the Speedrunning Moderation team are the **changes brought with Jump King relating to blocks**, such as low gravity and warp blocks. Warp blocks are following the new [v1.8.2 changes](/publicv182) and playing all levels with low gravity will be slightly slower than in JumpKingPlus, the walking and jump charge speed have been increased.

### What will happen to JumpKingPlus and its workshop?

Where most JumpKingPlus features by Nexile have been pleasantly ported over, some have been left out purposely. While **I totally understand and agree** on the reasons given, I don't like removing features especially if they are **deep-rooted of some user's muscle memory** or made for ease of use.

JumpKingPlus was born as a modified (or enhanced) version of Jump King. I can't tell how the future of JumpKingPlus will look like but I hope a solution will be found within Nexile in the future. There's a chance that JumpKingPlus will make it on the Workshop as a mod even if **it would need heavy reworks**.

Meanwhile for the Workshop, it will still be **available for the following months while the Steam Workshop update for Jump King is getting worked on**, but eventually when the update will be available to the public and made stable, **the JumpKingPlus' Workshop and its content will be archived**, meaning all the obsolete old download links will be removed and replaced with their relative Steam Item links. 

While it might be the end for JumpKingPlus here, it won't mean all will be lost! ðŸ™‚
