Hi guys, this is going to be more of a personal blog post rather than being informative, but honestly it's a good way to go back on the origins where this used to be a small mod and talk like there are no stakes involved.

It's been a 3-year-and-a-half wild ride and all this it couldn't be possible without many of you that gave me ideas, tips and improvements to make this how it looks today. I am **very grateful to everyone who downloaded** my silly edited version of Jump King, I'm not great with words but it honestly fills my heart knowing something I did left a positive mark in the community.

Without JumpKingPlus, I would have never be able to be in such a spot to land a job at Nexile, and with this job at Nexile I could focus everyday working on Jump King without the ripercussions of having to go to work lol (since thats the job, duhh).

But working for something that used to be your hobby and now its your full-time job can be very heavy, and it's exactly what I've felt like couple months in. I couldn't keep JumpKingPlus going forever, at least not alone. **<u>This had to stop</u>**, so that was my final idea for what has been 1 year on my mind, just retire JumpKingPlus. Each new release didn't feel gratifying anymore, it just felt like an added burden on me, and I don't want to remember JumpKingPlus as a burden.

Plus, with this workshop update, it felt even more of a burden knowing I'd have to take a lot of my freetime just to port over the entirety of a mod that is not compatible anymore. Instead of being a full fledged mod that I'd have to port, <u>I'd port each feature on my own pace on the Workshop</u> depending if I want to do it or not so it doesn't feel like a burden on me either.

You know the phrase "Health comes first"? Well, recently I've learned that I've been taking my mental health for granted way too much just to please some people. Which is not really healthy, something I want to change about myself. So if you have a mod idea, do it yourself! ü§™ <br>In all seriousness though, I'm always down for feedback that's game related especially since I'm still working for Nexile, but don't expect me to carry the Jump King community like I used to do all these years.

### Very special thanks

I would not have been in this position if many at the start didn't consider trying it out. So I want to list all the fellas that shaped JumpKingPlus how it looks today:

#### The other developers
First and foremost, without the others' work:
- we would have never gotten a good lookin' Workshop (big thanks for **MERNY** for the constant help on putting items on the Workshop and on Youtube ü´°);
- we would have never gotten other custom blocks (big thanks to **Ellie**, the girlboss of JK+ blocks üíÖ)
- we would have never gotten a multiplayer update (big thanks to **Sahandevs**, the legend that codes C# on Visual Studio Code ü§ì)

#### The MVPs
- **laayuman**, **IntroCar** and **Cheese**; for being always there since the very start, for giving ideas and helping me by finding bugs,
- **Erkstock** and **DevilSquirrel** for their code support,
- **Abaddon**, **Volcanic** and **ÏùëÏõ° (cjm8026)** for their great ideas (and great Workshop content),
- **kebb**, **Cheese**, **Mars_Ao**, **Taft** and **Rossiyan** (basically the gilbert squad) for their help organizing the content on Youtube
- **skatman117**, **GGamer** (with his fortnite battle pass), **‰∫îÊúàÈõ®**, **dinoscythe63** (dino), **Shinobi**, **kkaero**, **tsiiga**, **Bruno** (dabrunL), **Mental**, **ambinub** (ambi), **zyx098**, **cal** (cal‚Ñ¢Ô∏è), **zGabriel**, **WkaQhdwhdk** for their help finding bugs,
- **Cloudy**, **Sunset_**, **"Special thanks, you"**, **Trombikus**, **Pog**, **lavamander**, **RIDGYY**, **Kurier**, **Meea**, **DolpIn_62**, **jotaro**, **Memzy**, **KampZu**, **Czar**, **PhantomBadger**, **Owen**, **.Gotch(„Åî„Å£„Å°)**, **Joe M** and everyone else that I've missed for making content with JumpKingPlus or just being involved in the community,
- **Hybriid**, **Cartewns**, **Crbknight**, **Bruno**, **Ambinub**, **Trimp**, **Valmerix**, **Lehvel**, **Casu**, **Hty_ra_t**, **Crep**, **Rifremore**, **Hanyeah** and others from the Jump King speedrunning community.

Thank you for everything.
<br>See you on the other side.
