    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This map was created to help teach jump king players and mapmakers about the surprisingly large variety of tech in the game, ranging from well known and easy to very obscure and difficult. Each tech has detailed instructions on how it works and how to perform it, and some have extra notes for mapmakers looking to incorporate the tech. All tech is optional in case you have difficulty.</p>
