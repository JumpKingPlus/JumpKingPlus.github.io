    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hearing that Babe is beyond Hell, you leave your hideout. You won't be able to meet Babe in Inferno without overcoming a number of hurdles. When you refuse to give up, you become the rightful person to cross humanity.</p>
    <h3>Sidenote</h3>
    <p>This map involves one fall for production. Boots & Ring are doable, but be prepared for pain.</p>
