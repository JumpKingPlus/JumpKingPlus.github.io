A short space themed map. Not too difficult, most players will probably beat this pretty fast.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This map is possible to beat with Giant Boots and Snake Ring (and both at the same time).</p>
    <p>There is a `.txt` file in the mods folder with links to all of the music and tools I used for this map.</p>
