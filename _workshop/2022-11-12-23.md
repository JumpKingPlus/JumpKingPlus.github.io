Once again, a new thrilling adventure begins. It can be hard and tiring at times, but don't give up! There is also a hidden area, but will you be able to find it?

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Your mind is blank. You don't remember anything, but you start jumping over and over again, as you've done before. Great places only heard in legends await you on your journey. Reach the top, and prove that you are worthy to be with the hot babe!</p>
	<p>(If you are having trouble playing BoD+, open JumpKing.exe config file(it's in Jump King folder.), and set "boomerProofRestart" value different. For example, if the value is True, set it False. But if it still doesn't work, please download and play no props version. Props means animation. But you can still see almost all animations with no props version. Only except an area. I'm so sorry about that.)</p>
