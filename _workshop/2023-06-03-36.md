    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Where am I? I was in Magnetic Skyscraper, but maybe I have come to other dimension again. The only thing I can do is jump and getting to the babe.</p>
	<p>(If you are having trouble playing BoD+, open JumpKing.exe config file(it's in Jump King folder.), and set "boomerProofRestart" value different. For example, if the value is True, set it False. But if it still doesn't work, please download and play no props version. Props means animation. But you can still see almost all animations with no props version. Only except an area. I'm so sorry about that.)</p>
