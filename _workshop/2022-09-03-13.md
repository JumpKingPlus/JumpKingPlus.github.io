    <p>You have no idea how much time has passed. Months? Years? Decades? Centuries? However long you've been lying, something deep in your soul has given you the strength to wake up. Looking around it seems nearly everything has been frozen in time save for one annoying crab. You spot a glimpse of purple through the surface and begin your journey to the top and yet again, Back to the Babe. Good luck King...</p>
